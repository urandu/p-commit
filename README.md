# p-commit
auto watch your projects and make commits automatically

this project is as a result of laziness. I needed to auto commit my changes and push just in-case I lost my machine. 

instructions

```
- copy the files auto-commit.sh and start-watcher.sh to the root of your project.

- run ./start-watcher

- thats it all changes will be auto-commited.

- of cos you can edit the auto-commit.sh file to enable automatic pushes

```
